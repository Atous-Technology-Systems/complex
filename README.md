# AetherBind: Quantum-Inspired Classical Grover Search

## Overview

AetherBind is a Java-based software application that provides a classical simulation of the Grover search algorithm. While Grover's algorithm is a cornerstone of quantum computing, AetherBind demonstrates how advanced classical data structures and algorithmic optimizations can significantly improve the performance of such simulations on conventional hardware. The core innovation lies in achieving an `O(√N log N)` time complexity for the classical Grover search, a substantial improvement over naive `O(N√N)` implementations.

## Features

*   **Optimized Classical Grover Search:** Implements a classical version of Grover's algorithm with `O(√N log N)` time complexity.
*   **Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation:** Utilizes a Segment Tree data structure to efficiently handle range affine updates and sum queries, crucial for the diffusion operator.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:** Includes a robust testing suite to benchmark and verify the algorithmic complexity and performance gains.
*   **Modular Design:** Built with a clear separation of concerns using Spring Boot, making it extensible and maintainable.

## Algorithmic Details

### The Challenge

The standard classical simulation of Grover's algorithm often involves iterating through all `N` elements of the search space in each of the `√N` iterations, leading to an `O(N√N)` total complexity. The goal of AetherBind is to reduce this to `O(√N log N)`.

### The Solution: Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation

To achieve the improved complexity, AetherBind employs a **Segment Tree** data structure. This tree allows for two critical operations to be performed in `O(log N)` time:

1.  **`querySum`:** Efficiently calculates the sum of amplitudes across any given range.
2.  **`rangeAffineUpdate`:** Applies an affine transformation (`f(x) = ax + b`) to all elements within a specified range. This is particularly important for the diffusion operator, which transforms amplitudes according to `new_amplitude = 2 * mean - old_amplitude` (an affine transformation with `a = -1` and `b = 2 * mean`).

By reducing the per-iteration cost from `O(N)` to `O(log N)`, and with `√N` iterations, the total complexity becomes `O(√N log N)`.

```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Java Development Kit (JDK) 21 or higher
*   Apache Maven 3.6.3 or higher

### Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the root directory of the project and run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

### Running the Application

YouThe application can be run directly from the command line:

```bash
java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Upon startup, a basic demonstration of the Grover search algorithm will be executed via the `AlgorithmRunner` CLI entrypoint, printing the results to the console.

### Running Tests

To execute all unit and integration tests, including the performance benchmarks, run:

```bash
mvn test
```
